"Adam Gregory","I was born in the country
Far away from city lights
Where the air is sweeter
Where I feel I feel alright
In the country I was born and raised
In the country, yeah
In the country
That's where I'm gonna stay
In the country

Yeah
Come on rosin up the bow
We'll party 'till the rooster crows
Gonna walk down a dirt road
Gonna work 'till I am done
I'm not sure where I'm goin'
But lord I know
Where I am from I'm from the country
I was born and raised
In the country, yeah
In the country
That's where I'm gonna stay
In the country

Yeah
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right here in the country
That's where I'll find my lover
That's where my children will be born
It's where I'm close to heaven

Yeah
In the country I was born and raised
In the country, yeah
That's where I'm gonna stay
In the country

Yeah
In the country I was born and raised
In the country, yeah
In the country
That's where I'm gonna stay
In the country

Yeah
Come on rosin up the bow
We'll party 'till the rooster crows
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right
Here in the country
Lets go, go
To the country
Lets go, go
Lets go, go
To the country
Lets go, go

Come on down to my place
We'll party 'till the rooster crows
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than right here in the country
Baby won't you pass the gravy please
"Won't you please pass the gravy","In the Country
"","Adam Gregory","Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour?"
Me too

Like we're being guided by some higher power
Me too

Do you kinda get the feeling this feeling's so right
There must be a reason we're together tonight
Do you think it might be love we're falling into?
You do?
Me too

Don't you want to know where this emotion is going?
Me too

Wouldn't you hate to go through life never knowing?
Me too

Is it my imagination or is something so strong
Going on between us that it can't be wrong
Do you think you've got the heart to see this through?
You do?
Me too

Do you think you've got the heart to see this through
I really want to know baby, tell me the truth
Do you think it might be love we're falling into?
You do? You do? You do...
Me too
Me too

Do you feel your heart beating a million miles an hour?
Me too

Like we're being guided by some higher power?
Me too

Say you do, say you do, say you do
Say you do, say you do, say you do
Can you feel it?
Baby!, can you feel it?
Can you feel it baby?
"Me too"",Me Too"
"Adam Gregory,""There are moments in your life "
That are frozen in your mind
That will change the heart of how you feel forever
And I remember the rain
The sky was black
You were tryin' to fix a flat I knew I'd never be the same
The second I pulled over
It was me It was you
The world fell away from where we stood
And the ground around us moved
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed
And only love can make a memory like that, a memory like that
The very first time that we kissed I felt your fingers on my skin
As they wrote the worlds I love you baby
There are reasons for the rain I can still see yesterday
All I have to do is close my eyes
To picture our first memory
It was me
It was you
The world fell away from where we stood
And the ground around us moved
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed
And only love can make a memory like that, a memory like that
Right here, right now
We're making new memories
Of you and me, yeah
It was me
It was you
The world fell away from where we stood
And the ground around us moved
We were soaked to the bone
We slipped and fell, but we both laughed
And only love can make a memory like that
A memory like that
Only love can make a memory like that
"A memory like that..."",Memory Like That"
"Adam Gregory,""There's a town by a river"
And a dirt road that runs through the town
Winding around

As a child I would daydream
Where that road might take me
When my time for leavin' came down
And each night I'd awaken
From a dream I was takin'
That 'ol dirt road out of this town

Sweet memories keep haunting me
Callin' me like an old friend
And I pray that someday
I'll ride this highway
'Till it turns to that dirt road again

Now I live in the city
Where man made mountains of steel
To block out the sky
And that river of traffic
That runs by my window
Never seems to run dry

And tonight before sleeping I pray God is keeping
That old place that I left behind
Sweet memories keep haunting me
Callin' me like an old friend
And I pray that someday I'll ride this highway
'Till it turns to that dirt road again

In the city tonight
When I turn out the lights
"I'll be ridin' that 'ol dirt road again","Sweet Memories"
